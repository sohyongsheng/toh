Run `python run.py`. We'll see something like this:

    Step: 0
        A: 3 2 1
        B:
        C:
    ...

- A, B and C are the three pegs.
- The numbers represent the size of the disks.
- Our goal is to move all disks from peg A to peg C.

Modify the code accordingly to change the initial number of disks.
